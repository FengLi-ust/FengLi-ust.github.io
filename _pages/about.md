Hi, I'm a junior student majoring in Computer Science in [South China University of Technology, Guangzhou](http://www.scut.edu.cn/english/index.html). I'm currently a research assistant in HCP lab at SYSU, advised by Prof. [Xiaodan Liang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~xiaodan1/). I'm also an research intern in [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), working closely with Prof. [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/). Before that, I was an research intern in Univeristy of Alberta, working with Prof. [Di Niu](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~dniu/Homepage/Home.html) and Prof. [Ivor Cribben](https://www.ualberta.ca/business/about/contact-us/school-directory/ivor-cribben).

**As a PhD applicant for Fall 2021, I'm actively seeking for potential collaborations and positions.**

Here is my Curriculum Vitae in [pdf](../files/CV.pdf) or [web](https://cshlzhang.github.io/cv/).

Research Interests
======
My research interest broadly lies in machine learning and artificial intelligence in general. I'm currently working in developing AI capable of learning both from concrete examples (as DNNs do) and abstract knowledge (definitions, logic rules, etc) with (integration)[../files/integration.pdf] of low-level perception with high-level reasoning.

Publications
======
1. Bang Liu, Hanlin Zhang, Di Niu, Linglong Kong, â€œFactorizing Historical User Actions for Next-Day Purchase Prediction," under review to ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB), 2019
