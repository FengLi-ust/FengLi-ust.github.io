Hi, I'm a last-year undergraduate in South China University of Technology, majoring in Computer Science advised by Prof. Xinglin Zhang. I will go to the State Key Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences to study for a PhD in 2021, advised by [Tan Tieniu](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~tantieniu), Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Here is my Curriculum Vitae in [pdf](../files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf) or on the [web](https://yfZhangCs.github.io/cv/).

**Research Interests**
* Unsupervised Learning: deep generative models, contrastive learning
* Computer Vision: person re-identification, object detection
* Causality: causal inference
* Internet of Thimgs: crowdSourcing, incentive mechanism design
