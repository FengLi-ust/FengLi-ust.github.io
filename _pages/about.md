Hi, I'm a last-year undergraduate in South China University of Technology, majoring in Computer Science advised by Prof. Xinglin Zhang. I will go to the State Key Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences to study for a PhD in 2021, advised by [Tan Tieniu](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~tantieniu), Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Here is my Curriculum Vitae in [pdf](../files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf) or on the [web](https://yfZhangCs.github.io/cv/).

**Research Interests**
* Unsupervised Learning: Deep Generative Models, Object Oriented Learning
* Computer Vision: Pedestrian Re-IDentification, Object Detection
* Causality: Causal Inference
* Internet of Thimgs: CrowdSourcing, Incentive Mechanism Design
